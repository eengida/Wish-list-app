## About
Whenever birthdays or holidays come around, it is so difficult finding gifts for your friends and family. Either nobody knows what they want, or they come up with random gifts they would never touch again and would end up in the donation bin.

This app could help you track items you would want throughout the year but would never actually buy for yourself. Rather than writing in the notes app which could be cluttered and you would not be able to find online again, you can link the website, add a photo, or maybe even list where you found it and the price it was. 

This would help avoid that awkward moment and help your gifts be that much more memorable! :')
* In this application, you can log in and add as many items as you like to the wishlist
* When you search for friends, you will find friends whose wishlist has an item that matches an item in your wishlist.
